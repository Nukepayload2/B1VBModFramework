# B1VBModFramework
A VB MOD framework of Black Myth Wukong.

It's currently in Alpha stage.

Requires [B1CSharpLoader 0.0.6](https://github.com/czastack/B1CSharpLoader)

## How to compile the library
- Clone [B1CSharpLoader](https://github.com/czastack/B1CSharpLoader).
- Edit `Nukepayload2.GameMods.BlackMythWukong.vbproj`.
- Update value of `<B1CSharpLoaderPath>` to the root path of `B1CSharpLoader`, make sure that the path separator is the last character.

## How to use it to make MODs
WIP.

We'll publish a VB project template and then complete this part.
